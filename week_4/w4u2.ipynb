    "To open a file there is the function `open()`. For further operations on the file there are methods like `.write()`,\n",
    "`.read()` or `.close()`. Furthermore there are libraries which offer additional functions for special file formats like\n",

    "Additionally, the mode in which the file is to be opened can be specified optionally. The available modes are listed in\n",
